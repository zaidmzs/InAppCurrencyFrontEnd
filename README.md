# InAppCurrencyFrontEnd

This Project is Built on Angular and Nest Js (Node js) and Dynamo db.
We have created front End in angular and backend in Node js and AWS Lambda and dynamo db in which we created the rest api and we use post for signup and get for login from users table.
We created another table for transaction in which sender and reciever number are saved with the amount transfered.
We created another table for purchasing course in which We save user Number and Course Purchased.
But We could not Completed the project because of short time and api and front end could not interact with each other.
